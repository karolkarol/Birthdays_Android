The best birthday calendar to stay informed about upcoming birthdays of friends and family!

Free, easy, fast - and without ads!

Just open this lightweight app (only 895 KB) and see whom you have to congratulate next and how old this person turns then.

You don't have to fill in extra information, just type in the day of birth in your contact list and never forget your friends' birthdays again - the built-in countdown always reminds you. You can also add birthdays without a phone contact, just type in the name and date - and if you want, you can add a picture, too.

Of course, the included birthday reminder lets you know when you need to congratulate your friends. Really, you can never forget any birthday again!

• External storage (SD card / read and write): The app has an import/export feature so that you can save all your birthdays to the external storage and restore them, if needed (e.g. on a new device).
• Automatically start at boot: Necessary for setting up the birthday reminder again when the phone has been restarted.
